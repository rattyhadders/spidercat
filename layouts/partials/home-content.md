Spidercat. We are Badger, Ratty, and Dog. We live on a farm in Sussex, UK, and make epic, psychedelic, rock/pop. We are not a spider, or a cat.

__Badger Brewington__ on Bass, Vocals, and Keys. Space-shaman, eco-spiritualist, Artist, and Poet. Can feel the energy on Mount Caburn. Loves ale and mushrooms.

__Ratty Hadders__ on Guitar. Fuzzjunkie, personal hygene issues, stoner, and uber geek. Likes fixing tractors and making his own guitar pedals. Loves ale and weed.

__Doggy Dunton__ on Drums. Gentleman farmer, bon-viveur, and charmer. Knows the name of every plant. Loves good food and old cars.
