Tell us a little about yourself? My name is Badger Brewington, Iâ€™m the singer and bass player for Spidercat. I also play synth and keys occasionally. Ratty Hadders is our guitarist and Doggy Dunton plays drums. Ratty and I have been playing together since we were kids. We got to know Dog more recently.</description></item></channel></rss>
