Badger plays 4-string Jazz bass, keys, and synth. Ratty plays 6-string electric guitars of various kinds. Dog plays the drums and is a perfect gentleman. It features various modulations and reharmonizations of the melody. We hope it brings you amusement and pleasure.
We raise a glass to you all!</description></item><item><title>Critical Mass</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/critical-mass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/critical-mass/</guid><description>Critical Mass is a Sci-Fi fantasy written by Badger about a character who&amp;rsquo;s an indentured labourer on an asteroid mining ship deep in the outer solar system. The ship is a rusty old hulk, the safety officer is dead, and the captain is stoned. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise when the reactor goes critical and they have to escape.</description></item><item><title>Dog's Dinner</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/dogs-dinner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/dogs-dinner/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cat Orchestra Debacle</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/cod/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/cod/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Aftermath</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/aftermath/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/aftermath/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fisherman</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/fisherman/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/fisherman/</guid><description/></item><item><title>I Don't Want To Fall</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/idwtf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/idwtf/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sunshine</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/sunshine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/sunshine/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interview</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/top/interview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/top/interview/</guid><description>This was an interview Badger did did with the Is My Music Fire blog, published on 5/3/2021.
Tell us a little about yourself? My name is Badger Brewington, Iâ€™m the singer and bass player for Spidercat. I also play synth and keys occasionally. Ratty Hadders is our guitarist and Doggy Dunton plays drums. Ratty and I have been playing together since we were kids. We got to know Dog more recently.</description></item></channel></rss>
