A psych-rock epic telling of Badger&amp;rsquo;s shamanistic rituals. Travelling to another space and time on the psychedelic potions of the shaman spirit master. Will he ever return? What we he tell us? Who will he be?
Badger sings, plays 4-string Jazz bass, does synth noodles, and travels to the spirit world. Ratty plays 6-string electric guitars of various kinds and smokes far too much weed. Dog plays the drums, congas, various bells, and wears a cravat.</description></item><item><title>Shades of Green</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/shades-of-green/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/shades-of-green/</guid><description>A little instrumental follow up to our last single, So Green. Ratty took the chorus melody and composed some variations on it. Two short minutes of psych-rock with four individual sections. There&amp;rsquo;s weirdness, there&amp;rsquo;s all out Spidercat rock, a dream sequence, and a grande finale.

A delicious slice of classic English psychedelica. Written by Spidercat&amp;rsquo;s vocalist, bass player, and shaman, Badger Brewington, it tells of his love of the Sussex countryside. A dreamy George Harrison-esque verse gives way to a chorus of bubbling groovy bass and catchy organ hooks, in the middle is an excursion into jazz. Truly a slice of WAH filled wonderment.

Badger plays 4-string Jazz bass, keys, and synth. Ratty plays 6-string electric guitars of various kinds. Dog plays the drums and is a perfect gentleman. It features various modulations and reharmonizations of the melody. We hope it brings you amusement and pleasure.
We raise a glass to you all! Merry Christmas!</description></item><item><title>Critical Mass</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/critical-mass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/critical-mass/</guid><description>Critical Mass is a Sci-Fi fantasy written by Badger about a character who&amp;rsquo;s an indentured labourer on an asteroid mining ship deep in the outer solar system. The ship is a rusty old hulk, the safety officer is dead, and the captain is stoned. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise when the reactor goes critical and they have to escape.</description></item><item><title>Dog's Dinner</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/dogs-dinner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/dogs-dinner/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cat Orchestra Debacle</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/cod/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/cod/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Aftermath</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/aftermath/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/aftermath/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fisherman</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/fisherman/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/fisherman/</guid><description/></item><item><title>I Don't Want To Fall</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/idwtf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/idwtf/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sunshine</title><link>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/sunshine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spidercat-band.com/posts/sunshine/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
