A little instrumental follow up to our last single, So Green. Ratty took the chorus melody and composed some variations on it. Two short minutes of psych-rock with four individual sections. There's weirdness, there's all out Spidercat rock, a dream sequence, and a grande finale.

* __Badger__ plays 4-string Jazz bass and keyboards.
* __Ratty__ plays 6-string electric guitars of various kinds and smokes far too much weed.
* __Dog__ plays the drums and wears a cravat. Jolly good!

Mixing and mastering by Ratty.

Cover by Badger. It features Ratty in his Shades of Green.
