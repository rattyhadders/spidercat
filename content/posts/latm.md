Look At The Moon. A psych-rock epic telling of Badger's shamanistic rituals. Travelling to another space and time on the psychedelic potions of the shaman spirit master. Will he ever return? What we he tell us? Who will he be?

* __Badger__ sings, plays 4-string Jazz bass, does synth noodles, and travels to the spirit world.
* __Ratty__ plays 6-string electric guitars of various kinds and smokes far too much weed.
* __Dog__ plays the drums, congas, various bells, and wears a cravat. Jolly good!

Production by Ratty.

Cover by Badger. It features Badger and The Shaman under a full moon.

## Lyrics

Look at the moon\
Shining in the night sky\
Hear the rain\
Splashing on your windowpane\
Feel the sun\
Shining down on everyone\
And the wind\
Blowing through your mind\
Blowing through your mind\
Blowing your mind away\
\
In the pages of a book\
Long ago forgotten\
Lies a recipe to alter minds\
How to gather up the herbs\
Mix them with the spices\
And how to say the magic word\
\
And when it happens\
It really really happens\
It takes you to another space and time\
All colours dancing the sunlight are alright\
It never has to end\
It never really ends\
\
CH\
\
As the Shaman sings his song\
The fire slowly rises\
The shadows dance upon the wall\
As I gaze into the flames\
They seem to paint a picture\
But am I really here at all?\
\
But then it happened\
It really really happened\
It took me to another space and time\
All the colours dancing in the moonlight\
Were out of sight\
It really blew my mind\
It really blew my mind\
It really messed my mind\
Let Ratty do it\
\
CH
