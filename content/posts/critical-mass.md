Critical Mass is a Sci-Fi fantasy written by Badger about a character who's an indentured labourer on an asteroid mining ship deep in the outer solar system. The ship is a rusty old hulk, the safety officer is dead, and the captain is stoned. It's no surprise when the reactor goes critical and they have to escape.
