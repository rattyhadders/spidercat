So Green. A delicious slice of classic English psychedelica. Written by Spidercat's vocalist, bass player, and shaman, Badger Brewington, it tells of his love of the Sussex countryside. A dreamy George Harrison-esque verse gives way to a chorus of bubbling groovy bass and catchy organ hooks, in the middle is an excursion into jazz. Truly a slice of WAH filled wonderment.

* __Badger__ sings, plays 4-string Jazz bass, keyboards, and experiments with psilocybin micro-dosing.
* __Ratty__ plays 6-string electric guitars of various kinds and smokes far too much weed.
* __Dog__ plays the drums and wears a cravat. Jolly good!

Mixing and mastering by Ratty.

Cover by Badger. It features Ratty walking past the old barn.

## Lyrics

So green\
Love song of the lark\
Kaleidoscopic emerald canopy\
Bow hills\
Ancient as the stone\
Old Gods proud before the sea\
Oak heart\
Majestic Sussex weed\
Lay your seed spread before the sun\
Glorious Mu\
Buddha of the field\
Mother earth goddess divine\
\
So green\
So alive\
All conspires to satisfy my eye\
My eye\
My eye\
\
Take my hand\
Lead me to the wood\
Tenderly to teach me of your heart\
Freeze the sun\
Static in the sky\
Forever in your arms to lie\
\
So green\
So alive\
All conspires to satisfy my eye\
My eye\
My eye
