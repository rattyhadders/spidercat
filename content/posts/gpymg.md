Here is our Yuletide offering, God Prog Ye Merry Gentlemen, a cheesy proggy arrangement of an ancient Elizabethan English carol.

* Badger plays 4-string Jazz bass, keys, and synth.
* Ratty plays 6-string electric guitars of various kinds.
* Dog plays the drums and is a perfect gentleman.

It features various modulations and reharmonizations of the melody. We hope it brings you amusement and pleasure.

We raise a glass to you all! Merry Christmas!
